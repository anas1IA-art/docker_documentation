        "# Docker Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "**Docker** allows you to run applications in isolated environments, known as containers, which operate within your preferred Linux distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Containers** are similar to virtual machines, but they are more lightweight.\n",
        "- You can create an image where you pre-install software, make configurations, and run it on your local machine or the cloud (e.g., Kubernetes).\n",
        "- Docker ensures that the same image can run across multiple environments like:\n",
        "  - Development\n",
        "  - Testing\n",
        "  - Acceptance\n",
        "  - Production\n",
        "\n",
        "## Benefits of Docker:\n",
        "- Docker enables parallel environments, such as testing and performance analysis.\n",
        "- Supports progressive deployment with feature flags or ring-based deployments.\n",
        "- **Consistency**: The same Docker image runs in different environments, reducing discrepancies.\n",
        "- **Efficiency**: Docker caches components that don't change, making updates faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How Docker Works:\n",
        "1. Install Docker.\n",
        "2. Define your environment settings using a **Dockerfile**.\n",
        "3. Create a Docker image.\n",
        "4. Run the image as a container locally or on any server."
